# Monopoly-Tests

## Description
Hello all, this is an old Python project I wrote to do a simulation to test using multiple files and learning matplotlib.

MonopolyFunctions.py - Mainly here for testing. Has the "take" and "roll" commands to take a chance or community chest card and roll respectively

Tile.py - Adds the "Tile" class and adds all the spaces to the game

monopolytest.py - The OLD exectuable I used before I cleaned up my spaghetti code

NewTest.py - Although I understand this is still spaghetti code, you must admit it looks better than what I had before

## The Program

This program, when run, simulates running around the monopoly board tons of times and keeps track of position. I then created a bar graph of which spaces were landed on the most.
After, I used a score board to add up the scores of each monopoly in terms of frequency landed on
Finally, I prettied up my findings and created two plots: one plotting each tile and frequency and one plotting the scores of each monopoly
